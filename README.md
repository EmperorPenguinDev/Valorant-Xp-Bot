# Valorant XP Farming Bot
Code may be slightly unoptimized. If you think you can improve it, please make a pull request.


# Instructions

1- Install Python (3.9.0 is what I wrote the code in, will probably work with 3.5.x +)

2- Open _PackageInstaller.bat as admin to install dependencies using pip.

3- Open Valorant, go to PLAY and then click on DEATHMATCH.

4- Open bot and then press 1.

5- Choose which Player Card you want to use, change to that one in game and then select it in the bot console.

6- Follow instructions that will appear on screen if you haven't already.
