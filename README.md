# More info about the program

If you don't know how to use the program, check README.md in the folder

Change theingame.png in 1080 folder | check README.md

the program was created by jordan123pal and re-edited by WolfAnto for Valorant

Low chance to get ban due to the Deatchmatch gamemode. Only by player reports

The exp gain is quite slow due to the very long Deathmatch queue. ~900xp/15min

In 1 hour you can get 3600 exp | 8 hours: 28 800exp | 24 hours: 86 400 exp

These estimates are the minimum you can earn

the code is not optimised so may cause fps drops and crash after several hours
