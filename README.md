# Valorant Xp Bot

Warning!

I'm totally bad at python so be indulgent if you see any horrors in the code. xd

# Instructions

BEFORE START THE PROGRAM : Change the ingame.png image to your own banner in loading screen (check example.png in Tutorial folder)
                           It's best to take a banner with a simple pattern so that the script doesn't crash or get confused.

1.- place the game in English

2.- Install python (3.8.5 32 bits)

2.- Open .bat with admin for install libs.

3.- open Valorant and go to lobby and choose Deathmatch.

4.- open bot, enter 1 and go Valorant lobby.

5.- ready.

6.- only work for 1920x1080 resolution

# More info about the program

If you don't know how to use the program, check README.md in the folder

Change the ingame.png in 1080 folder | check README.md

the program was created by jordan123pal and re-edited by WolfAnto for Valorant

Low chance to get ban due to the Deatchmatch gamemode. Only by player reports

The exp gain is quite slow due to the very long Deathmatch queue. ~900xp/15min

In 1 hour you can get 3600 exp | 8 hours: 28 800exp | 24 hours: 86 400 exp

These estimates are the minimum you can earn

the code is not optimised so may cause fps drops and crash after several hours
