# Valorant XP Farming Bot
Code may be slightly unoptimized. If you think you can improve it, please make a pull request.

ONLY WORK FOR WINDOWS 10

# REQUIREMENTS

Run the batch file as Administator to install the dependencies. Works on 64bit Windows 10 with Python 3.8 +

Install Python 3.8.0 here Install Python 3.9.0 here

For the program to function properly, please copy and paste your OWN Valorant shortcut for the program to function properly. This makes it so if Valorant encounters any issues when AFK, it can restart the game. You should not need to edit any code.

# Instructions

1- Install Python (3.9.0 is what I wrote the code in, will probably work with 3.5.x +)
   If doesn't work with Python 3.9.0 try with Python 3.8.5

2- Open _PackageInstaller.bat as admin to install dependencies using pip.

3- Open Valorant, go to PLAY and then click on DEATHMATCH.

4- Open bot and then press 1.

5- Choose which Player Card you want to use, change to that one in game and then select it in the bot console.

6- Follow instructions that will appear on screen if you haven't already.


# Help

Make sure when installing python, you check the box next to "Add Python 3.8 to PATH"
